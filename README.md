# WhereCamp

The Where2.0 Conference is no more and we need to continue a place and time where people fascinated by the power of location technology can gather to share ideas, show off projects, and connect our community. WhereCamps are a distributed un-conference held in different cities that host a free event where anyone can come to talk about geo!

Anyone can run a camp, it typically requires a venue that accomodates 30-50, depending on the amount of geo your city can muster, Wifi internet, power, some stickynotes and markers, and a lot of energy. We are currently [planning camps](https://github.com/ajturner/wherecamp/wiki) in a number of cities, but if you would like to run a camp...
 
## Planning

* Read the [wiki](https://github.com/ajturner/wherecamp/wiki) for details of camps
* Add or Resolve [tasks](https://github.com/ajturner/wherecamp/issues) each city camp
* Follow [@wherecamp](http://twitter.com/wherecamp) on Twitter

## What is the event like?

WhereCamp is built on the ideas originally put forth by [FooCamp](http://wiki.oreillynet.com/foocamp06/index.cgi), except that attendance is open to anyone. It is an un-conference where the attendees drive the content of the sessions of the day, instead of having a prescribed schedule and set of content. Therefore, the event is what you make of it, and is only as fun as the people who attend. So be prepared to speak and contribute. If you're still not sure, then read up on the original FooCamp and BarCamps - these events are a radical shift from the kinds of conferences you may be used to and draw on a set of specific tools to invite and foster participation as pioneered by Allen Gunn among others.
